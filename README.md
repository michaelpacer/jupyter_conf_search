In order to use this 

    pip install jupyter_conf_search 

Which is then executed as 

    jupyter_conf_search "your_search_term"

on the command line to search for "`your_search_term`".

If you pass just 

    jupyter_conf_search

it will return the total list of configuration files that it found relative to
the directory that you are running the command from (not just the directories,
which you can find using `jupyter --paths` beneath `config:`).
